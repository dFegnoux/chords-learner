# Chords learner
Hey ! I'm Denis, I enjoy playing the bass and i'm actually learning my chords and I work as a front end Developer. 

So I was thinking that maybe I can develop something to visualize chords on a fret board. I saw some website that can guess what chord you are trying to do, but my objective here is simple. The app gives you a chord and you have to find it on the fret board. 

The actual app : https://dfegnoux.github.io/chords-learner/

The thing is, every time I've started a personal project, i never ended it. So today I start this one *but* i link the associated Trello board to see where i'm going. (I don't know if it's a good or bad idea... well i'll find out later) https://trello.com/b/6DY5MB1C/chords-learner

Oh ! I'm using React (create-react-app FTW), I'm use to it, it's the only reason for this choice :)
